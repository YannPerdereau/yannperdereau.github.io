**Welcome to my webpage!**

I'm a fourth year PhD student in Economics at the [Paris School of Economics](https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/en/) under the supervision of Gilles Saint Paul. My research focuses on macroeconomics, households heterogeneity, and fiscal and monetary policies. I am currently doing a PhD Traineeship at the Directorate General Research of the [European Central Bank](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/home/html/index.en.html).

[Geography versus income: the heterogeneous effects of carbon taxation](/files/Geography versus Income, The Heterogeneous Effects of Carbon Taxation.pdf), with Charles Labrousse, March 2025. 2023 [CEPR Philippe Martin Prize](https://cepr.org/about/news/inaugural-philippe-martin-prize-awarded-cepr-paris-symposium) recipient.

  <p>The distributive effects of carbon taxation are critical for its political acceptability and depend on both income and geographic factors. Using French administrative data, household surveys, and matched employer-employee records, we document that rural households spend 2.7 times more on fossil fuels than urban households and are employed in firms that emit 3 times more greenhouse gases. We incorporate these insights into a spatial heterogeneous-agent model with endogenous migration and wealth accumulation, linking spatial and macroeconomic approaches. We find that rural households experience 20% higher welfare losses, and failing to account for geography in optimal revenue recycling lowers aggregate welfare by 7%.</p>

[Balance sheet policies and Central Bank losses in a HANK model](/files/Balance sheet policies and Central Bank losses in a HANK model.pdf), with Charles Labrousse, April 2024.

<div id="abstract2" style="display:none;">
  <p>What are the effects of central bank balance sheet expansion, and should we worry about central bank losses? Using a Heterogeneous Agent New Keynesian model incorporating money in utility and an endogenous zero lower bound (ZLB), we study the fiscal-monetary interaction of central bank balance sheet policies. We find that the overall efficiency of QE and QT policies depends on the combination of the expected future size of the balance sheet and the fiscal transmission of central bank losses. First, permanent balance sheet expansions stimulate the economy in the long-run and, by anticipation, increase inflation and output during the ZLB episode, as they interact with distortionary taxes and imperfect capital markets. Second, at the end of the ZLB, the central bank incurs losses: issuing securities to offset these losses is more welfare-enhancing than raising taxes.</p>

[Luxury for All: A Theory of In-kind Benefits and Inequality](/files/Luxury for All, A Theory of In-kind Benefits and Inequality.pdf), with Charles Labrousse, June 2025.
<button onclick="toggleTexte('abstract3')">Abstract</button>
<div id="abstract3" style="display:none;">
  <p>Much of the existing literature models in-kind benefits as an exogenous parameter G, implicitly relying on a missing market hypothesis, even though many of these goods have private counterparts. This paper develops a new theory of public spending based on two key features: government-provided goods are luxury goods, and they generate concave externalities. First, we show that these two conditions are necessary and sufficient for optimal public provision to be positive. Second, using household-level surveys and administrative data from multiple countries, we classify in-kind benefits and confirm their luxury status. Third, we embed these findings into a heterogeneous-agent model with multiple goods and both public and private consumption. We use the model to: (i) quantify the shape of externalities consistent with observed policies; (ii) examine how optimal provision responds to inequality; (iii) derive the optimal path of public debt reduction; and (iv) revise Distributional National Accounts methodology to account for in-kind benefits.</p>
