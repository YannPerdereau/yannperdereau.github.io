**Welcome to my webpage!**

I'm a fourth year PhD student in Economics at the [Paris School of Economics](https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/en/) under the supervision of Gilles Saint Paul. My research focuses on macroeconomics, households heterogeneity, and fiscal and monetary policies. I am currently doing a PhD Traineeship at the Directorate General Research of the [European Central Bank](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/home/html/index.en.html).
